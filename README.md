# Earthquake_Greece_Predict
Electrons data mining.Visualization and intresting display!

Data are being explorted from https://aer-nc-web.nict.go.jp/radi/data/Himawari/realtime/5min/

Auto download and viualize using Robust peak detection algorithm (using z-scores) finding peak of electron signal.

Predicted data appear after 3 days (~1 day Asia/India)(~2 days Iran/Turkey/Cyprus/Rodus)<b>(~3 days Romania/Greece)</b>(~4 days Italia)=23/3  

<b>Comming Earthquake</b>

<b>The earthquake</b> (GMT +2)

So...  
(~1 day Asia/India)=19/3  
(~2 days Iran/Turkey/Cyprus/Rodus)=20/3  
<b>(~3 days Romania/Greece)</b>=<b>21/3</b>  
(~4 days Italia)=22/3  

As we can see from the example above (lag=676(=2day and some hours),threshold=1,influence=2) we expected a big earthquake for  21/3 (estimated time 03:55 local time = 1:55 UTC)

On 20/3 a big earthquake occured at Iran (2nd day) and on 3rd day a big earthquake occured at Greece.
